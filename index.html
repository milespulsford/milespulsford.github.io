			<h1>About the data</h1>
			<p>From 2002-2004, two professors at Columbia Business School held experimental speed dating events. Attendees would sit down for a succession of four-minute dates with each participant of the opposite gender. After each date, participants rated their partner on six criteria and decided whether or not to "like" them. If two participants liked one another, they were given their partner's contact information so that they could follow up after the event.</p>

			<p>Turns out putting more effort into dating is correlated with	 success! Of course, it might be that people who find success in dating are more likely to keep doing it.</p>

			<p>We are actually slightly LESS likely to be attracted to someone who is attracted to us!</p>

			<p>Attractive people are more selective, but not dramatically so:</p>
